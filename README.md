An awesome binary game for SFOS!

The code of this app is pretty ugly as this is my first app for Sailfish OS - sorry for that. If you have any improvements, feel free to make a pull request.
 
The principle of this game is to type a given decimal number in binary as fast as possible (see screenshot).
