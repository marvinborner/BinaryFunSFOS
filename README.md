An awesome binary game for SFOS!

The code of this App is pretty ugly as this is my first app for Sailfish OS - so sorry for that. If you have any improvements, feel free to create a pull request.
 
The principle of this game is to type the given decimal number in binary as fast as possible (see screenshot).
